* Inline Lua!
* Automatic linking of libraries and inclusion of header files in a block of inline C when functions are not found. Like printf, sin, cos and SDL_CreateRenderer.
* Possibly syntax for linking with libraries, that connects with pkg-config? "use sdl" should use the right link and inclusions.

* Local variables (.bss section or on the stack? ) or heap?
        * .data for constants
	* .bss for uninitialized variables
	* the heap for local variables that will not use too much memory?
	* the stack for the rest?

* Return values (not only eax/rax etc)
* Add and fix local variables. Use the .bss section. (Remember to include .bss when building kernels)
* Remove the [ebp-8] local variable testing code.
* Add the assembly version of printf.
* Make it easy to link with OpenGL or SDL2.
* Parse trees instead of token lists, for function calls.
* Use the go module for tokenizing
* Test on Cygwin on Wine as well, possibly change the uses of uname


--- done ---
* Make syscall() work correctly, ref hi64.bts [done]
* Create a write() function [done]
