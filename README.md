Battlestar
==========

What is Battlestar?
-------------------

* A work in progress.
* Created for fun and for the educational process.
* A programming language specifically for 64-bit and 32-bit x86 and Linux.
* Basically assembly with friendlier syntax, with support for inline C.
* The indended purpose is for writing 4k and 64k demoscene demos.

Features
--------

* The resulting executables are tiny!
* "hello world" is only 131 bytes on 32-bit Linux (with sstrip installed)
* It's possible to write an operating system with only one source file
* Full support for inline C (with gcc installed)
* C and Battlestar code can exist in the same source file and calls can be made both ways.
* Battlestar programs compiles almost instantly
* Programs can be run like scripts by including this line at the top: ```#!/usr/bin/bts```
* Interrupts can be called with the same syntax for both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 on Linux.

In progress
-----------
* OS X support

Build dependencies
------------------
* go

Runtime dependencies
--------------------
* yasm

Optional runtime dependencies
-----------------------------
* gcc (for inline C support)
* sstrip (part of elftools) for even smaller binaries
* binutils (for disassembling with objdump)
